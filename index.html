    <h1>Leaders Eat Last - Simon Sinek</h1>
    <i>'Why some teams pull together and others don't'</i>
  </br>
  <hr>
</br>

  <p>
    Why do some teams trust each other so deeply that they would literally put
  their lives on the line for each other. Other teams, no matter what incentives were offered, were doomed to in-fighting, fragmentation and failure?
  <br>
  <br>
  The answer lies in the ability of the leaders to sacrifice their interests for the good of those in their care and to build what the author calls a <i>Circle of Safety.</i>
  When everyone feels they belong, all energies are devoted to facing the common enemy and seizing big opportunities.
  <br>
  <br>

  The leaders who are willing to eat last are rewarded
  with deeply loyal, inspired and effective colleagues.

     "Instead of trying to command-and-control everything, the leaders should devote all their energy in training, building and protecting
     their people - to managing the 'Cirlce of Safety' - so that the people can command and control any situation themselves.
     That's the best way to protect the legacy of the leader and extend the success of the company 
     for many years after the leader departs."

                The world round us is filled with danger. Filled with things trying to make our lives miserable.
                It's nothing personal; it's just the way it is.
                At any time and from anywhere, there are any number of forces that, without conscience are working to hinder 
                our success and even kill us. In caveman times, this was literally the case.
                The lives of early humans were threatened by all sorts of things that could end their time on earth.
                Things included a lack of resources, a saber-toothed tiger or the weather.
                <br>
                The same is true today - the threats to our survival is constant.
                For our modern day business and organizations, the dangers we confront are both real and percieved.
                Saber-toothed tigers have been replaced by ups and downs of the market that can affect a company's performance.
                A new technology could render an entire business model obsolete overnight.
                These dangers are constant. They are never going to go away and they will never change. That's just the way it is.
                <br>
                <br>
                There are dangerous forces inside our organizations as well, initimidation, humiliation, isolation, feeling dumb,
                feeling useless and rejection are all stresses we try to avoid inside the organization.
                <br>
                But the danger inside is controllable and it should be the goal of leadership to set a culture free of danger from
                each other.
                And the way to do this is by giving people a sense of belonging. By giving them the power to make decisions.
                By offering trust and empathy. By creating a 'Circle of Safety'.
                <br>
                Without a Circle of Safety, people are forced to spend too much time and energy protecting themselves from each other.

                The Spartans, a warrior society in ancient Greece, were feared and revered for their strength, courage 
                and endurance. The power of the Spartan army did not come from the sharpness of their spears, however; it came 
                from their strength of their shields.
                <br>
                Losing one's shield in a battle was considered the single greatest crime a Spartan could commit.
                "Spartans excuse without penalty the warrior who loses his helmet or breastplate in battle," "but punish
                the loss of all citizenship rights the man who discards his shield."
                <br>
                And the reason was simple. "A warrior carries helmet and breastplate for his own protection, but his shield for the safety of the whole line."
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Likewise the strength and endurance of a company does not come from products or services but from how well
                their people pull together.</b>
                The more we trust that the people to the left of us and the people to the right of us have our backs, the better equipped we are 
                to face the constant threats from the outside together. Every member of the group plays a role in maintaining the 
                Circle of Safety and it's the leader's role to ensure that they do.
                This is the primary role of leadership, to look out for those inside their circle.

                  Decades ago, scientists in Britain set out to study the link between employee's place on the corporate
                  ladder and stress. Known collectively as the Whitehall Studies, the studies' findings were both 
                  astounding and profound. Research found that workers' stress was not caused by a higher degree of 
                  responsibility and pressure usually associated with rank. It is not the demands of the job
                  that cause most stress, but the degree of control workers feel they have throughout their day.
                  Put simply: less control, more stress.
                  <br>
                  The study was about our sense of control over our work and, indeed, our lives.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  A supportive and well-managed work environment is good for one's health. Those who feel
                  they have more control, who feel empowered to make decisions, suffer less stress.
                  Our feelings of control, stress, and our ability to perform at our best are directly tied to how safe
                  we feel in our organizations.
                  When we know that there are people at work who care about how we feel, our stress levels decrease.

            Thanks to the trial and error of evolution, almost every detail about our physiology
            is there for a reason. Mother nature did not provide us with highly tuned taste buds simply so we could
            enjoy a fine glass of wine from Staglin Family Vineyard. Our taste buds tell our digestive systems which enzymes to release
            to best deal with the food that is on its way down, just like our sense of smell helps us detect
            if food is spoiled or not.
            <br>
            Similarly our eyebrows were designed to help channel sweat away from our eyes when we were running toward prey - or running away to avoid
            becoming prey. Everything in our body was designed with one goal - to help us survive. This includes the feelings of happiness.
            <br>
            <br>
            Mother Nature figured out an incentive system to condition us to do certain things to achieve desired results.
            In the case of biology, our bodies employ a system of positive and negative feelings - happiness, pride, joy or anxiety, 
            for example - to promote behavior that will enhance our ability to get things done and to cooperate.
            <br>
            Our bodies reward us for working to keep ourselves and those around us alive and looked after with chemicals that make us feel good.
            And now, after thousands of years, we are all completely and utterly chemical-dependant.
            <br>
            There are four primary chemicals in our body that contribute to all our positive feelings that can be generically 
            called "happy": <b>endorphins, dopamine, serotonin and oxytocin.</b>
            Anytime we feel any sense of happiness or joy, odds are it is because one or more of these chemicals
            is coursing through our veins.
            They do not exist simply to make us feel good. They each serve a very real and practical purpose: our survival.

            Our ancestors of the Paleolithic era lived in times when resources were either scarce or hard to come by.
            Imagine if every time we felt hungry, we had to go hunting for a few hours... with no guarantee
            that we'd catch anything. Odds are our species would not have survived very well with a system like that.
            And so our bodies in an effort to get us to repeat behaviors that are in our best interest, came up with a way
            to encourage us to go hunting and gathering on a regular basis instead of waiting until we were starving.
            <br>
            Two chemicals - endorphins and dopamine - are the reason that, we are driven to hunt, gather and achieve. They make us
            feel good when we find something we're looking for, build something we need or accomplish our goals.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Endorphins - The Runner's High:</b> Endorphins serve one purpose and one purpose only: to mask physical pain.
            Think of endorphins as our own personal opiate. Often released in response to stress or fear, they mask physical pain with pleasure.
            The experience of "runner's high," the feeling of euphoria many atheletes experience during or after a hard workout, is in fact
            the endorphin chemical surging through their veins.
            <br>
            This is one of the reasons runners and other endurance athletes continue to push their bodies harder and harder.
            It is not simply because they have the discipline to do so; they do it because it actually feels good.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Dopamine - An Incentive for Progress:</b> Dopamine is the reason for the good feeling we get when we're looking for or doing something
            that needs to get done. It is resposnsible for the feeling of satisfaction after we've finished an important task, completed a project, reached a goal.
            We all know how good it feels when we cross something off our to-do list. That feeling of progress or accomplishment
            is primarily because of dopamine. It can help us get through college, become a doctor or work tirelessly to realize an imagined vision of the future.
            <br>
            But there is some fine print at the bottom of the bottle that is often missed. Dopamine is also highly, highly addictive.
            Cocaine, nicotine, alcohol and gambling all release dopamine. And the feeling can be intoxicating.
            <br>
            In a performance-driven organization in which dopamine is the primary means of reward - like gambling, we can become addicted to "making the numbers."

                  A carcass of a wildebeest floats down a river in Botswana. The soon-to-be meal passes
                  two hungry crocoldiles. Seeing the food, they both lunge at it... but only one will win.
                  The faster, stronger of the two will be the one to eat that day. Acting completely out of instinct,
                  it will consume the carcass and swim away with a full stomach, and absolutely no care in the world
                  about the other crocodile.
                  There is no part of the crocoldile's reptilian brain that rewards any cooperative behavior.
                  The animals have no positive feelings when cooperation is offered and thus no incentive to cooperate.
                  <br>
                  We, however, are not like crocodiles. We are anything but loners. The addition of the mammmalian layer of our
                  brain helped us to become highly functioning social animals. And for good reason. <b>If we weren't adapted to live in 
                  tribes and cooperate, we would have died off ages ago.</b>
                  We are just not strong enough to survive alone, let alone thrive.
                  Whether we like to admit or not, we need each other. That's where serotonin and oxytocin come in.
                  They are the backbone of the 'Circle of Safety'.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Serotonin</b> is the feeling of pride. It is the feeling we get when we perceive 
                  that others like or respect us. It makes us feel strong and confident.
                  As social animals, we more than want the approval of those in our tribe, we need it.
                  We all want to feel valuable for the effort we put forth for the good of others in the group or the group itself.
                  <br>
                  Whether we are a boss, coach or parent, serotonin is working to encourage us to serve those for whom we are
                  directly responsible. And if we are the employee, player or the one being looked after, the serotonin encourages to work hard to make them proud.
                  <br>

                  <b>Oxytocin</b> is most people's favorite chemical. It's the feeling of friendship, love or deep trust.
                  It is the feeling we get when we're in the company of our closest friends, when we do something nice for someone 
                  and someone does something nice for us. 
                  <br>
                  But oxytocin is not there to just make us feel good. It is vital for our survival instincts.
                  Without oxytocin we wouldn't want to perform acts of generosity, there would be no empathy, we wouldn't be 
                  able to develop strong bonds of trust and friendship.
                  <br>
                  Unlike dopamine, which is about instant gratification, oxytocin is long lasting.
                  The more time we spend with someone, the more we are willing to make ourselves vulnerable around them.
                  As we learn to trust them and earn their trust in return, the more oxytocin flows.

            That feeling that something is wrong is a natural early warning system all social animals have.
            It is designed to alert us to threats and heighten our senses to prepare for possible danger.
            That 'gut feeling' that we get when something dangerous is lurking is caused by a chemical called <b>cortisol.</b>
            <br>
            Cortisol is also behind the feeling of anxiety, discomfort or stress we have at work.
            <br>
            <br>
            Unfortunately, in many work environments where members of the group don't care much about one another's fate.
            Which means that valuable information is often kept secret. As a result bonds of trust among employees
            or between leaders and workers are weak.
            We are left almost without an option but to put ourselves first. If we are constatly worried that if we make a mistake,
            we will get in trouble, if we think that someone we work with will try to take credit for something we did
            or stab us in the back to get ahead.
            If we do not feel the 'Circle of Safety', cortisol starts to seep through our veins. Drip. Drip. Drip.
            <br>
            This is a serious problem. For one thing, cortisol actually inhibits the release of oxytocin, the chemical
            responsible for empathy. This means when there is only a weak 'Circle of Safety' and people must invest 
            time and energy to guard against politics and other dangers inside the company, it actually makes us even more selfish 
            and less concerned about one another or the organization.

            Each of the feel-good chemicals is essential for our survival as individuals and as a population.
            <br>
            Our ability to work hard and muscle through hard labor is thanks to endorphins.
            <br>
            Our ability to set goals, focus and get things done comes from the incentivizing powers of dopamine.
            <br>
            Serotonin is responsible for the pride we feel when those we care for achieve great things or when we 
            make proud the people who take care of us.
            <br>
            And the mysterious power of oxytocin helps us form bonds of love and trust. We know that if we need help or support 
            the people who care about us will be there for us, no matter what.
            <br>
            <br>
            The goal for any leader of any organization is to find balance. When dopamine is the primary
            driver, we may achieve a lot but we will feel lonely and unfulfilled no matter how rich or 
            powerful we get. Dopamine simply does not help us create things that are built to last.
            When we live in a hippie commune, the oxytocin gushing, but without any specific measurable goals
            or ambition, we can deny ourselves those intense feelings of accomplishment.
            <br>
            When the system is in balance, however, we seem to gain almost supernatural ability.
            Courage, inspiration, foresight, creativity and empathy, to name a few.
            When those things all come to bear, the results and the feelings that go with them are simply 
            remarkable.

            Spencer Silver, the scientist who is partially credited with the creation of Post-it, was actually trying to develop
            a very strong adhesive. Unfortunately, he wasn't successful.
            What he accidently made was a very weak adhesive. Based on the job specs given to him, he had failed.
            But Silver didn't throw his "failure" in the trash out of embarrassment. He didn't keep his misstep a secret out of fear for his job 
            or guard it closely in the hopes of someday profiting from it.
            In fact, the unintentional invention was shared with others at the company... just in case someone else could figure out a way to use it.
            <br>
            <br>
            And that's exactly what happened. A few years later. Art Fry, another scientist at 3M, was in church choir practice getting frustrated that
            he couldn't get his bookmark to stay in place. It kept falling out of the page, off the music stand and onto the floor.
            He remembered Silver's weak adhesive and realized he could use it to make the perfect bookmark!
            And that was the birth of what would become one of the best-recognized brands in history, with four thousand
            varieties sold in over a hundered countries.
            <br>

            Innovation is not simply the result of educational pedigree or technical expertise. Innovation
            is the result of a corporate culture of collaboration and sharing.
            Hearing one person's solution to a problem can inform someone else how to solve a problem of their own.
            Isn't this the idea of learning - to pass on our knowledge to others?
            <br>
            A corporate culture that encourages and rewards people for helping each other and sharing everything they learn, will always succeed.
            Inside a Circle of Safety, when people trust and share their success and failures, what they know and what they don't 
            know, the result is innovation. It's just natural.

            In physics, the definition of power is the transfer of energy. We measure power of a lightbulb
            in watts. The higher the wattage, the more electricity is transferred into light and heat and the more
            powerful the bulb.
            <br>
            Organizations and their leaders operate exactly the same way. The more energy is transferred from the top of the organization 
            to those who are actually doing the job, those who know more about what's going on on a daily basis,
            the more powerful the organization and the more powerful the leader.
            <br>
            <br>
            The best leaders share what they know, ask knowledgable people help perform their duties and make introductions to create new relationships
            within their networks.
            <br>
            When leaders reveal their gaps in knowledge and missteps, not only are we more willing to help, but we too are 
            more willing to share when we make mistakes and when things go wrong. In organizations in which there is no safety provided,
            people are more likely to hide mistakes or problems out of self-preservation.
            The issue is, those mistakes or problems, if not addressed, often add up and appear later when they become too big to contain.

              For seventy-five years, Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) has successfully helped people 
              beat the dopamine addiction of alcoholism. Most of us have heard of their twelve-step program 
              to recovery.
              <br>
              Few if any of the alcoholics enrolled in AA will find sobreity until they complete Step Twelve. Even if they make it through the other
              eleven steps, those who do not complete Step Twelve are very likely to drink again.
              <br>
              Step Twelve is the commitment to help another alcoholic beat the disease. Step Twelve is all about service. And it is the
              service that is the key to breaking our dopamine addictions in our organizations too.
              It's the service to our colleagues whom we work every day.

              What's the difference between a leader and a manager? 
              <br>
              The answer to this million dollar question is very simple - managers look after our numbers and results; and leaders
              look after us.
              <br>
              Leadership is about taking responsibility for lives and not for numbers.
              <br>
              <br>
              Leaders see the forest for the trees, they can see beyond the system - or the resource to be managed - to see
              the people doing all the work.
